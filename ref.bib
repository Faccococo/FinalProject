    abstract = "{The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",

Features are processed across all scales and consolidated to best capture the various spatial relationships associated with the body. We show how repeated bottom-up, top-down processing used in conjunction with intermediate supervision is critical to improving the performance of the network. We refer to the architecture as a ``stacked hourglass'' network based on the successive steps of pooling and upsampling that are done to produce a final set of predictions. State-of-the-art results are achieved on the FLIC and MPII benchmarks outcompeting all recent methods.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive survey of facial feature point detection with the assistance of abundant manually labeled images. Facial feature point detection favors many applications such as face recognition, animation, tracking, hallucination, expression analysis and 3D face modeling. Existing methods are categorized into two primary categories according to whether there is the need of a parametric shape model: parametric shape model-based methods and nonparametric shape model-based methods. Parametric shape model-based methods are further divided into two secondary classes according to their appearance models: local part model-based methods (e.g. constrained local model) and holistic model-based methods (e.g. active appearance model). Nonparametric shape model-based methods are divided into several groups according to their model construction process: exemplar-based methods, graphical model-based methods, cascaded regression-based methods, and deep learning based methods. Though significant progress has been made, facial feature point detection is still limited in its success by wild and real-world conditions: large variations across poses, expressions, illuminations, and occlusions. A comparative illustration and analysis of representative methods provides us a holistic understanding and deep insight into facial feature point detection, which also motivates us to further explore more promising future schemes.}
